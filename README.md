My pet project, where tasks was to develop a web application that allows you to receive newsletter and cryptocurrency rate monitoring.
The user registers on the service and selects several currencies to be monitored. After that, the user goes to the home page, where the charts of currency changes are displayed. In addition, the service records currency values into the database every hour by cron. And every day at 8 a.m. it sends a mailing to users with the changes in the values of the cryptocurrency selected by the user.
