My pet project involved developing a web application that enables users to receive newsletters and monitor cryptocurrency rates. Users register on the service and choose several currencies for monitoring. Afterward, users navigate to the home page, where charts depicting currency changes are displayed. Additionally, the service records currency values into the database every hour through a cron job. Furthermore, every day at 8 a.m., it sends a newsletter to users containing updates on the values of the cryptocurrencies selected by the user.
